Some brief file descriptions follow.  If you're looking to use these scripts and are confused, please email me at rrohlfs@berkeley.edu.  

autYsim.c: 
given population sample autosomal allele frequencies and Y-haplotype frequencies, simulates pairs of relatives and runs the Myers et al. parent-offspring/sibling identification routine, writing the test statistics to file

autYsimUnrelPopPair.c: 
given population sample autosomal allele frequencies and Y-haplotype frequencies, simulates pairs of unrelated individuals from each pair of population samples and runs the Myers et al. parent-offspring/sibling identification routine, writing the test statistics to file

autYsimAnalysisDeux.R: 
given the results of an autYsim.c run, calculates identification rates for different specified relationships and draws plots of these results

autYsimAnalysisDeuxSubSamp.R: 
given the results of an autYsim.c run with subsampling of Y-haplotype reference samples, calculates identification rates for different specified relationships and draws plots of these results

autYsimUnrelPopPairAnalysis.R: 
given the results of an autYsimUnrelPopPair.c run, calculates false positive identification rates for under the Myers et al procedures and draws plots of these results

probterms.c and probterms.h: 
probability functions for autosomal genotypes and Y-haplotypes under various relationship assumptions

simfunctions.c and simfunctions.h: 
functions to simulate autosomal genotypes and Y-haplotypes under various relationship assumptions

myio.c and myio.h:
convenient in-house functions to read in/out files/variables

mystat.c and mystat.h:
convenient in-house functions to do some basic statistical functions
